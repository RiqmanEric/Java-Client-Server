This project is an implementation of a client/server relationship.This is a core feature used in Distributed Systems. The server offers services that can be accessed by several clients.

In this project the server offers three finacial services. It offers:
1: Simple interest calculator
2: Compound interest calculator
3: Future value calculator

The server runs first then the client follows. When a connection is established, the client is given a choice of the three services. The client is served with the service it chooses from the server.
